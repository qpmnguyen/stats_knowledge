# Introduction  

This book is an attempt at categorizing all statistical knowledge that I know into one big massive book for personal reference. It's not in textbook format (does not flow information from basics to advanced), and chapters are kind of arbitrary.

# Basic statistics {#basic}



<!--chapter:end:01-intro.Rmd-->

# Basic Regression {#basic_reg}  

This chapter contains some basic regression models, which includes
